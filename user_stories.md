## User Stories (MVP)

### For the User (Focus Group):
* Allow the user's input from using this app to help create a fun catalog of items for Puget Sound bus commuters 
* Offer a catalog of fun items for the user to flip through by selecting which one of three items they would most likely purchase 
* There will be a total of 25 rounds of selection, after which point the user will get to see their results as (i) total number of clicks (ii) total clicks per item

### For the Client (Busmall's Marketing Research Team):
* Be able to create a catalog that features only the items that are the most likely to sell
* Achieve market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest before actually putting them into the catalog and following through with manufacturing
* View the total number of clicks, along with the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.

### For the Developer:
* Build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side)
* Manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images that display side by side;
* Determine which product, of the three displayed images, a user would most likely purchase. Then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.
* After a total of 25 selections have been made, display the results to the user.
* Make regular commits to track development progress.
* Style the app.
